I suggest creating a .flaskenv file with the contents
```
FLASK_APP=app
FLASK_DEBUG=True
```

To run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
flask run
```
index.html and script.js are for just for backend testing purposes. That's why they are here and not in /frontend

# plant planner up and running - TEAM 3
- get local weather
- Is it safe to plant? T or F.
- Recommend plants that can survive the weather
